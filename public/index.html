    <h3>Other benefits of Clipper 2.0</h3>
    <div>
      <span class="question">Tap and Ride with contactless credit & debit cards</span><br>
      <p class="answer">
        If you ride transit infrequently, or just don't want to have to keep track of yet another
        card in your wallet, the new Tap and Ride system will allow you to use your normal contactless
        credit or debit card to pay. This reduces complexity for riders and means less confusion for new riders,
        occasional riders, and tourists.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Clipper cards will still be quite useful for many, though. Discount programs, like Clipper START, Clipper RTC,
        and youth and senior discounts will not be available when paying with Tap and Ride. Likewise, transit benefits
        programs and BART's High Volume Discount programs will not be available with Tap and Ride.

      <span class="question">Fixing the BART excursion fare</span><br>
      <p class="answer">
        Today, if you enter the BART faregates and then realize that they've suspended service,
        tapping back out of the faregates will charge you $7.10. This fare was designed for people
        who would want to either explore the system on an "excursion".
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        With Clipper 2.0, people who tap out less than 30 minutes after tapping in will not be charged
        an excursion fare. This "grace period" is especially useful when BART experiences service outages,
        since riders will be able to leave the platforms and catch alternative transit without having
        to speak to a station agent.
